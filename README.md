# webbased_visualization
1. I have visualized the Motor Vehicle Collision injuries and death in NYC, January 2016 dataset. It visualizes the data based upon the "casualty", "hour of the day" and "weekday".  Created a time slider. The circles have different color and size based on the casualty. 
2. Added a scroll option which draws the attention of the user towards the important locations and added images and videos related to them.
3. when you click on the circles you can get details about the incidence at that point.
4. A fit button fits a location specified.
5. Map view changes according to the zoom level. There are two types of zoom one is gaming zoom and other is the map control zoom.
6. The distance between two points can be measured by clicking on the two positions.
7. The properties of any location are shown at the bottom left corner while moving the cursor on the screen.
